## Design Explanation
### Why did you choose this class?
It is because plants are a common yet interesting object we often see. I also chose this to make monitoring a plant’s information and process more efficient, especially since it needs daily care.

### Which property is the most important? Why?
The property waterstatus is the most important because it reminds the user whenever you need to water your plant. It tells you when the plant needs care.

### Which method is the most useful? Why?
The growth(amount : double) is the most important because it keeps the plant’s growth and progress documented and analyzed.
